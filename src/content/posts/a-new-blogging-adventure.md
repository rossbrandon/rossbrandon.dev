## What is this?

_Maybe not an "adventure" per say. Or really all that new. New for me, I suppose._

This is my first attempt at a personal/technical blog. Honestly, I don't think anyone will care to read any of this but that isn't the point. I want (and need) to start writing down things I do and problems I solve so that I can come back to look at them without having to go through the process again when I inevitably forget it all ðŸ˜„.

It will also be a good place for me to work on fleshing out ideas and thoughts about things I want to do in the future. And who knows, maybe I will enjoy it and end up benefitting someone else in the tech community.
