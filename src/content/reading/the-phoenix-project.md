This is a fiction novel but is so on point in describing the problems of software engineering culture in large companies that I kept having to put it down out of the frustrating accuracy of it in comparison with my own life. It does do a fantastic job of describing the problems of "corporate bloat" with processes and how disruptive unplanned work can be to planned work. Through comparing an IT organization to a manufacturing floor, The Phoenix Project uses a clever and mysterious character to push the protagonist to figure out optimizations on his own while he goes through the process of improving the IT organization of a major auto parts supplier.
