I actually started reading this one a few years ago but finally finished it in 2021. This one is a classic "must-read" for any programmer, in my opinion. It's examples can be a bit out dated, but the concepts are timeless in developing clear software. Uncle Bob is one of the most influential and respected programmers out there and this book addresses how to organize, refactor, document, and test your code. He focuses on picking the right design patterns to accomplish your goals in a simple manner while allowing for your code to scale. I highly recommend any software engineer pick this up.
