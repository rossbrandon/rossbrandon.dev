#### the basics...

I am software architect / full-stack engineer with a passion for data-driven, privacy-centric development.

Yes, I truly believe that both of those things can be done simultaneously 😄.

#### a little history...

In 2011, I moved to Austin, TX freshly graduated from the [University of Arkansas](https://www.uark.edu/) (Go Hogs!! 🏈) to begin my career as a full-stack developer with [Hewlett-Packard](https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html). At HP, I was quickly thrown into the deep-end working with the _Finance IT_ teams. Elbow deep in global financial transaction and reconciliation systems, I quickly gained a lot of experience with high-throughput global transactional processing, developed an internal tool that automated reconciliations for over 35 financial and supply chain systems averaging over 120 million transaction reconciliations per month, and even dipped my toes into SAP HANA.

By the end of my 7-year tenure at HP, I got to be a part of the (hopefully) once in a lifetime experience of splitting a major corporation into two entities: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP, Inc. While separating the financial systems we owned between both now independently traded companies, I resided for roughly two years with HP, Inc.

Technologies I frequently used at HP: Java, Oracle, SQL Server, Unix/Linux (HP-UX and then later RedHat Linux), Struts 2 MVC web development (Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3).

#### next...

In 2017, I began a new opportunity working with the popular e-commerce platform, [Magento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magento), writing backend APIs for our move towards cloud based commerce. I was mostly new to PHP at this point and quickly gained experience in modular extension development in both Magento 1 and Magento 2 systems.

Technologies I frequently used at Magento: PHP, MySQL, SPA web development (Javascript - React).

#### and then...

[Adobe to Acquire Magento Commerce](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2018/Adobe-to-Acquire-Magento-Commerce/default.aspx)

After about a year and a half with Magento, Adobe acquired and officially transformed us into [Adobe Commerce](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/magento-commerce.html) as we are known today. This acquisition proved to lead to the most interesting and exciting portion of my career yet...

Enter the return of Java! After my brief stint as a PHP developer, I was presented with the amazing opportunity to work on a new _Data Solutions_ team building a shiny feature being developed for Adobe Commerce in order to catch up with the e-commerce market: [Product Recommendations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/product-recommendations/overview.html?lang=en). This was the first step in moderizing the monolith stack into a multi-tenant SaaS offering with a very key feature: [personalization](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/operational-playbook/product/personalization.html?lang=en).

From there, I asked to stay on the Data Solutions team permanently and became the Product Recommendations team lead, designing and developing many of our SaaS microservices that are in high use today thoughout Adobe Commerce.

#### currently...

I currently reside as a software architect for two teams within the Data Solutions organization (we grew from a small, scrappy greenfield team into a large organization -> #corporate-life). My primary focus is delivering service oriented architecture transformation though our _Core SaaS_ team as well as driving innovation in our unified data indexing and ranking platform powering our [live search](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/overview.html?lang=en) and recommender services with more to come!

Technologies I frequently use at Adobe Commerce: Java, Spring Boot, DynamoDB, MongoDB, gRPC/REST/GraphQL, Snowplow, Snowflake, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, SQS/Kafka, and I still dabble in frontend occasionally (SaaS hosted Javascript in React).

Overall, I absolutely love what I do and I am proud to be a part of building the next generation e-commerce platform at Adobe. Check back for updates on other exiting initiatives my teams will be a part of in the future!
