I read this book a very long time ago, but I wanted to mention it here because it had such a simple yet profound impact on how I approach and view the value of time at work. It directly addresses how disruptive and destructive unnecessary meetings and process can be. Especially since it is such a quick read, I highly recommend this to anyone working in a corporate setting. It will cause you to second guess your own processes and learn how to better respect your own and other's time.
