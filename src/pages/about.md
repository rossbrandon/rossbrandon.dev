#### the basics...

I am software architect / full-stack engineer with a passion for data-driven, privacy-centric development.

Yes, I truly believe that both of those things can be done simultaneously 😄.

#### a little history...

In 2011, I moved to Austin, TX freshly graduated from the [University of Arkansas](https://www.uark.edu/) (Go Hogs!! 🏈) to begin my career as a full-stack developer with [Hewlett-Packard](https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html). At HP, I was quickly thrown into the deep-end working with the _Finance IT_ teams. Elbow deep in global financial transaction and reconciliation systems, I quickly gained a lot of experience with high-throughput global transactional processing, developed an internal tool that automated reconciliations for over 35 financial and supply chain systems averaging over 120 million transaction reconciliations per month, and even dipped my toes into SAP HANA.

By the end of my 7-year tenure at HP, I got to be a part of the (hopefully) once in a lifetime experience of splitting a major corporation into two entities: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP, Inc. While separating the financial systems we owned between both now independently traded companies, I resided for roughly two years with HP, Inc.

Technologies I frequently used at HP: Java, Oracle, SQL Server, Unix/Linux (HP-UX and then later RedHat Linux), Struts 2 MVC web development (Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3).

#### next...

In 2017, I began a new opportunity working with the popular e-commerce platform, [Magento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magento), writing backend APIs for our move towards cloud based commerce. I was mostly new to PHP at this point and quickly gained experience in modular extension development in both Magento 1 and Magento 2 systems.

Technologies I frequently used at Magento: PHP, MySQL, SPA web development (Javascript - React).

#### and then...

[Adobe to Acquire Magento Commerce](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2018/Adobe-to-Acquire-Magento-Commerce/default.aspx)

After about a year and a half with Magento, Adobe acquired and officially transformed us into [Adobe Commerce](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/magento-commerce.html) as we are known today. This acquisition proved to lead to the most interesting and exciting portion of my career yet...

Enter the return of Java! After my brief stint as a PHP developer, I was presented with the amazing opportunity to work on a new _Data Solutions_ team building a shiny feature being developed for Adobe Commerce in order to catch up with the e-commerce market: [Product Recommendations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/product-recommendations/overview.html?lang=en). This was the first step in moderizing the monolith stack into a multi-tenant SaaS offering with a very key feature: [personalization](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/operational-playbook/product/personalization.html?lang=en).

From there, I asked to stay on the Data Solutions team permanently and became the Product Recommendations team lead, designing and developing many of our SaaS microservices that are in high use today throughout Adobe Commerce. We grew from a small, scrappy greenfield team into a large organization: #corporate-life.

#### currently...

I currently reside as a software architect (who is still heavily involved in writing code 🤓) for Adobe [Commerce Optimizer](https://business.adobe.com/products/commerce/commerce-optimizer.html). My primary focus is designing and delivering incredibly powerful, [personalized](https://business.adobe.com/products/commerce/commerce-personalization.html), and [fast](https://business.adobe.com/products/commerce/digital-storefront-experiences.html) e-commerce solutions to our customers (especially with complex businesses and use cases) and their shoppers.

Technologies I frequently use at Adobe Commerce: Java, Typescript, Python, Go, MongoDB, DynamoDB, gRPC/REST/GraphQL, Snowflake, Elasticsearch, SQS/Kafka, and Argo/Kubernetes.

Overall, I absolutely love what I do and I am proud to be a part of building the next generation e-commerce platform at Adobe. Check back for updates on other exiting initiatives my team will be a part of in the future!
